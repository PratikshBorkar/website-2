              <h1>Birth and Family Background:</h1></BR>
               <p> Shivaji Bhosle, later known as Shivaji Maharaj, was born on February 19, 1630.</p>
                <br><p> He was the son of Shahaji Bhosle, a Maratha general serving under the Deccan Sultanates, and Jijabai, a woman of strong character and deep religious beliefs.</p>
                <br><p>Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near Junnar in the Pune district of present-day Maharashtra, India.
                 <br> From a young age, Shivaji was exposed to military tactics and governance, owing to his father’s position and his mother’s teachings.
                  He was instilled with a sense of pride in his heritage and a vision to establish Swarajya (self-rule) for the Marathas.
                  </p>
                <br><p>Shivaji's mother, Jijabai, played a crucial role in his upbringing. She instilled in him a sense of pride in Maratha heritage, a deep devotion to Hindu gods, and an unyielding sense of justice.
                  Shivaji was mentored by his mother's spiritual guru, Dadoji Konddeo, who trained him in administration, statecraft, and warfare. This training included the use of guerrilla tactics, which would later become a hallmark of his military strategies.
                  </p>
                  <br><p>At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Golkonda, and the Mughal Empire. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar,
                     the Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.</p>
  <br><p>Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.</p>
  <br>
  <br><br><h2>Spouses and Children of Shivaji Maharaj</h2><br>
 <p> Shivaji Maharaj had several wives and two sons. His elder son, at one stage, defeated the Mughals and was brought back with the utmost difficulty.  Many are unaware of the fact that Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj has eight wives. His first wife was Saibai, also known as Nimbalkar. </p><br>
 <p> The names of the other wives were Soyarabai, Mohite, Putalabai, Palkar, Sakvarbi Gaikwad, Sangunabai, and Kashibai Jadhav. His first wife, Saibai, bore him Sambhaji and three daughters. Soyarabai bore him a son named Rajaram and a daughter named Deepabai. His other children were Rajkunvarbai from his wife Sagunabai and Kamlabai from Sakvarbai. In 1659, his first wife, Saibai, passed away at a very young age due to a prolonged illness.</p>

              <br>
                 <h2>Father:Shahaji Bhonsle</h2>
             <br>
           <p>Shahaji was the son of Maloji Bhosale, a Maratha warrior and nobleman who had been awarded the jagirs of Pune and Supe, Ellora, Dheradi, Kannrad and some more villages in the districts of Jafrabad, Daulatabad and Ahmadabad by Sultan Murtuza Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar.</p>
<br> <p> According to Shiva Digvijay, a text considered to be a modern forgery by historians such as Jadunath Sarkar and Surendra Nath Sen,Maloji's wife Umabai allegedly prayed in the tomb of Sufi Pir Shah Sharif of Ahmadnagar to be blessed with a son. Later when Maloji and Umabai settled in Devagiri, Umabai went on to give birth to two sons, first of whom was Shahaji and second one was Sharifji, born two years later.</p>
<br> Shahaji was betrothed to Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhav, the Maratha Deshmukh of Sindkhed in the service of Ahmadnagar's Nizamshahi Sultanate, when both of them were children.
<br><br>
<p> Like his father Maloji, Shahaji served in the army of Malik Ambar, the prime minister of Ahmadnagar Sultanate. At the time of Maloji's death in 1622, 26-year old Shahaji was a minor commander in Malik Ambar's army.By 1625, he held the high military position of Sar Lashkar, as suggested by a letter sent from Pune on 28 July
       </p><br>
       Ahmadnagar was involved in conflicts against the northern Mughal Empire and other Deccan Sultanates, and Shahaji kept switching his loyalty between these states. For example, sometime before the Battle of Bhatvadi in 1624, Shahaji and some other Maratha leaders defected to the Mughals, but shortly before the battle they returned to Ahmadnagar. Malik Ambar's army defeated a combined Mughal-Bijapur force in the battle.
        Subsequently, a quarrel arose between Shahaji and his cousin Kheloji Bhonsle, and in 1625 Shahaji shifted his allegiance to Bijapur,
         likely because he was dissatisfied with Ahmadnagar rewarding his relatives more than him. He retained his jagir in the Pune region, which was disputed between Ahmadnagar and Bijapur.
       A letter dated 10 January 1626 indicates that he still held the position of Sar Lashkar.
       <br><br>
       Ibrahim Adil Shah II, Shahaji's patron in Bijapur, died in September 1627. Adil Shah, a Muslim, was tolerant towards Hindus like Shahaji and saw Ahmadnagar as a buffer state between his kingdom and the Mughal Empire. After his death, an orthodox Muslim faction that advocated for an alliance with the Mughals against Ahmadnagar grew stronger in Bijapur.
        Amid these circumstances, Shahaji returned to Ahmadnagar in early 1628 under the patronage of Malik Ambar's son Fatah Khan.
       The power of Ahmadnagar had been declining after Malik Ambar's death in 1626, but Shahaji held a higher position there than the one he held in Bijapur. Meanwhile, the newly-crowned Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan launched a fresh campaign against Ahmadnagar. In 1629, Shahaji led a 6,000-strong cavalry force against the Mughals in the Khandesh region but was defeated.

        <h2>Mother:Jijabai Bhonsle</h2>
        <br><p>Jijabai  referred to as Rajmata, Rastramata, Jijabai, Jijamata or Jijau, was the mother of Chattrapati Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire.</p>
        <br><p>Jijabai was born on 12 January 1598, to Mhalasabai Jadhav and Lakhuji Jadhav at Sindkhed Raja in present-day Buldhana district of Maharastra. Jijabai was married at an early age to Shahaji Bhosle, son of Maloji Bhosle of Verul village, a military commander serving under the Nizam.</p>
      <br><p>Shivaji's mother, Jijabai, played a crucial role in his upbringing. She instilled in him a sense of pride in Maratha heritage, a deep devotion to Hindu gods, and an unyielding sense of justice. Shivaji was mentored by his mother's spiritual guru, Dadoji Konddeo, who trained him in administration, statecraft, and warfare. This training included the use of guerrilla tactics, which would later become a hallmark of his military strategies.
      </p><br><p>She died on 17 June 1674 at Pachad village near Raigad Fort. This was only twelve days after the coronation of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</p>

         Life History</H1>
         <br><br>
      <h2>Life History of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj:</h2>
      <br><br><p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha kingdom of India. The kingdom's security was entirely based on religious tolerance and the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.<br>
        <br>Shivaji Maharaj who was the descendant of a line of prominent nobles was very brave and fought many wars to consolidate India. At that time, India was under the Muslim rulers and divided. The Mughals were in north India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur as well as of Golconda in the south of India. <br>
      <br>  The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharaj were situated in the Deccan region in the realm of Bijapur sultans. He found the suppression of the Muslim rulers and the persecution of all the Hindus in the region. He was sad due to the devastating condition of the Hindus that by the age of 16 he convinced himself to be the cause of the Hindu’s freedom. It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.<br>
         </p><br><br>
         <h2>Childhood and Early Life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj:</h2>
         <br><p>He grew up studying Ramayana and also Mahabharata. He showed intense interest in the religious teachings, especially of the Hindu and Sufi Saints.<br> He was brought up by his mother Jijabai and also by his administrator Dadoji Kond Deo. Dadoji taught him horse riding, archery, patta, and also several other fighting techniques after his father left for Karnataka with his second wife Tukabai.
         </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Conquests of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
        <br><p>With this motive, Shivaji Maharaj began to seize the weaker Bijapur outposts and his followers. In this process, he ruined a few of his very influential coreligionists. They had aligned themselves with the sultans. His daring military skills and sternness towards the Hindus' oppression had him win many battles and administrations. His depredations grew very audacious, and various minor expeditions sent to chastise him always proved to be ineffective.</p><br>
        <p>In 1659, when the Sultan of Bijapur sent an army of around 20 thousand soldiers under the leadership of Afzal Khan to defeat him, Shivaji Maharaj intelligently defeated Afzal Khan. He pretended to be intimidated and enticed the force deep into the difficult mountain terrains and then killed Afzal Khan at a meeting to which he had lured him by all submissive appeals. 
        </p><br>For the time being, the handpicked troops that had been previously positioned swooped down on the unwary Bijapur army and routed it. Overnight, Shivaji Maharaj became a daunting warlord with the possession of horses, guns, as well as ammunition of the Bijapur army.<br>
        Alarmed by the rising strength of Shivaji Maharaj, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered his viceroy of the south to march against him. He encountered himself by carrying out a very daring and brave raid right within the encampment of the viceroy. In this raid, he lost his one hand and his son's fingers. <br>
        Embarrassed by this reverse, the viceroy withdrew his force. After this incident, Shivaji was thought to provoke the Mughals. He attacked the rich coastal town of Surat and took immense booty.  Aurangzeb, disappointed and raged by this incident, could hardly ignore the loss, and to avenge Shivaji Maharaj, he sent out his most prominent general, Mirza Raja Jai Singh. Mirza Raja was sent along with 100 thousand men. <br>
The pressure that was exerted by this vast force which was also combined with the drive and tenacity of Jai Singh, very soon compelled Shivaji Maharaj to call for peace. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj undertook that he and his son would attend the court of Aurangzeb at Agra to be formally accepted as Mughal vassals. In Agra, hundreds and thousands of miles from their homeland, Shivaji Maharaj and his son were both placed under house arrest. During the house arrest, they lived under the threat of execution.<br><br>
Fearlessly, Shivaji Maharaj feigned illness, and therefore as atonement, he began to send out enormous baskets filled with delicious sweets that were to be distributed among the poor. In the year 1666 of 17 August, he and his son had themselves carried past their guards in these baskets. His escape was the most thrilling and daring episode filled with very high drama, which was about to change the course of Indian history. <br>
His devoted followers welcomed him back as their great leader, and in the coming two years after this escape, he achieved many wars. He not only conquered and won back the lost territories but also expanded his domain. He collected tribute from the Mughal regions and also raided their rich cities. He also reorganized the army and instituted reforms for his subjects' welfare. <br>
Taking lessons from all the English traders and Portuguese traders who had already gained toeholds in India, he began to build a naval force. He was the very first Indian ruler of his time to use sea power for trade and also for the defence of his region.<br>
Almost as though jabbed by Shivaji’s meteoric rise in power, Aurangzeb intensified his genocide and persecution of Hindus. Aurangzeb also imposed a poll tax on them, connived at forcible conversions, and also demolished temples, and erected mosques in their places.
